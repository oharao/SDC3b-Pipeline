# SDC3b-Pipeline

Following todays discussion, I have vaguely outlined the required steps for the SDC3b pipeline which aims to go from:

Cubes -> Lightcones -> Skymap -> Visibilities -> Inference

It would be beneficial if those who have time would take one of these components and develop it. I have left suggestions
on how I thought this may be combated in each file, but obviously free choice/will.

Following this I have added the list of sections below please add your name to the list so there is no doubling up 

Cubes: 
Lightcones:
Sky Model:
Visibilities:
Inference:
